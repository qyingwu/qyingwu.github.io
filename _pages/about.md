About Me

I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience in full-stack development, cloud computing (AWS), and scalable backend systems. Currently, I'm working at Visa Inc. on payment infrastructure while pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at UT Austin, where I focus on Machine Learning.

Bio
I graduated in late 2019 from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Computer Science. In early 2020, I joined Amazon as a Software Engineer to work on Alexa Payment Services. While I enjoyed the technical challenges at Amazon, I became increasingly interested in Machine Learning and decided to pursue higher education.

By late 2021, I was admitted to the Computer Science M.S. program at UT Austin, focusing on ML. In 2022, I rejoined Amazon to work on internal HR systems, including projects involving Generative AI. I continued my graduate studies alongside full-time work, taking classes at a manageable pace.

In 2025, I transitioned to Visa, where I now work on high-throughput, real-time payment processing systems—building scalable infrastructure for clearing and settlement, improving system performance, and driving operational observability.
Outside of work, I enjoy reading, cycling, fishing and carpentry.

Professional Experience
======
At Amazon, I led several impactful projects focused on scalability, automation, and intelligent systems:
* Development of full-stack platforms managing employee case data using React, TypeScript, and Java
* Integration of AWS services (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, SNS) for scalable operations
* Implementation of GenAI solutions that improved HR productivity (Summarization of chat/call conversations through Amazon connect)
* Building automated systems for streamlined workflows and improved efficiency

At Visa, I’ve been working on mission-critical backend systems within the OVN Payment Platform:
* Designed and implemented real-time alerting and monitoring for clearing valuation, enabling rapid issue detection.
* Optimized the Real-Time Valuation Processor, reducing message completion latency to under 20 ms.
* Developed a manual purging job to clean up stale advice entries and generate audit-compliant reports for downstream systems.
