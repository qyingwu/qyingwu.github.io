## About Me

I'm a software engineer with over **4 years of experience** in full-stack development, cloud computing (**AWS**), and scalable backend systems. I have hands-on experience working with **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, and **Kafka** to build resilient, microservice-based architectures.

Currently, I'm working at **Visa Inc.** on real-time payment infrastructure while pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science** at **UT Austin**, focusing on **Machine Learning**.

## Bio

I graduated in late 2019 from **UC Berkeley** with a **B.S. in Computer Science**. In early 2020, I joined **Amazon** as a Software Engineer to work on Alexa Payment Services. While I enjoyed the technical challenges at Amazon, I developed a deep interest in **Machine Learning** and decided to pursue graduate studies.

By late 2021, I was admitted to the **Computer Science M.S. program at UT Austin**, specializing in ML. In 2022, I rejoined Amazon to work on internal HR systems, including projects involving **Generative AI**. I continued my graduate studies part-time while working full-time.

In 2025, I transitioned to **Visa**, where I work on **high-throughput, real-time payment processing systems**. My work involves building reliable, event-driven infrastructure using **Kafka**, and deploying scalable microservices with **Kubernetes** and **Docker**. I focus on improving system performance, observability, and operational resilience.

Outside of work, I enjoy **reading, cycling, fishing, and carpentry**.
